            <p class="p-aboutme">
              I'm a 25-year-old passionate dancer and curious traveler who has
              been dancing since the age of 6. With a
              <span class="bold">lifelong passion for dance</span>, I've honed
              my skills in various dance forms over the years, including jazz,
              hip-hop, and contemporary dance.
            </p>
            <p class="p-aboutme">
              Aside from dance, I also have a
              <span class="bold">deep love for exploring the world</span>
              and learning about different cultures. I enjoy immersing myself in
              the local culture and trying new foods and discovering hidden gems
              that are off the beaten path.
            </p>
            <p class="p-aboutme">
              With a
              <span class="bold">curious mind and a thirst for knowledge</span>,
              I always seek new experiences and opportunities to learn. Whether
              it's trying a new dance style or learning a new language, I'm
              always eager to expand my horizons.
            </p>
            <p class="p-aboutme">
              Having
              <span class="bold">worked in the service industry</span> for
              several years, I've developed a strong passion for helping people
              and meeting new faces. This is a trait that I have carried forward
              into my career as a UX/UI designer.
            </p>
            <p class="p-aboutme">
              One of the reasons I was drawn to UX-design was my love for
              <span class="bold">creativity and my desire to help people</span>.
              The idea of designing user experiences that are not only visually
              appealing but also solve real-world problems and make life easier
              for people really excites me!
