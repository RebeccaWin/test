            <p class="p-smatrollen">
              Initially, we convened with the client to gain insight into their
              <span class="bold">vision</span> and ascertain their
              <span class="bold">preferences</span> for the proposed mobile
              website. During this consultation, we obtained a comprehensive
              understanding of the distinguishing features of their preschool,
              including their <span class="bold">unwavering commitment</span>,
              <span class="bold">active environmental stewardship</span>,
              <span class="bold">community engagement</span>, and emphasis on

            </p>

            <p class="p-smatrollen">
              The client expressed a desire for an
              <span class="bold">informative</span>,
              <span class="bold">well- structured</span>, visually appealing
              website that is <span class="bold">accessible</span> and
              <span class="bold">sustainable over time</span>. Additionally,
              they provided us with their current logo, several images of the
              preschool, the informative text and a color scheme that they
              wished to incorporate.

            </h2>
            <p class="p-smatrollen">
              We conducted a Heuristic Evaluation before commencing work on
              their new mobile website. This process involves using
              <span class="bold"
                >rules of thumb to assess the usability of user interfaces</span
              >. During the evaluation, we applied five of Jakob Nielsen's 10
              general principles for interaction design to generate a heuristic
              report. The purpose of this evaluation was to
              <span class="bold"
                >identify potential usability issues in the existing
                website</span
              >
              and utilize that knowledge to improve these aspects in the new
              website.
            </p>

            <p class="p-smatrollen">
              Specifically, when analyzing heuristic number 8 - Aesthetic &
              Minimalistic design - we observed
              <span class="bold">inconsistencies in image placement</span>
              and <span class="bold">text formatting</span>, making it
              challenging for users to comprehend information. Furthermore,
              there were instances of
              <span class="bold">unrelated images</span> being used on some
              pages.
            </p>

            <p class="p-smatrollen">
              Additionally, when examining heuristic number 4 - Consistency &
              Standards - we found that certain
              <span class="bold"
                >main headings had subheadings that duplicated their
                meaning</span
              >, which deviates from standard practice on other websites.
              Moreover, the website employed
              <span class="bold">eleven different colors</span>, exceeding the
              recommended maximum of seven. This practice adds excess visual
              information for users, making it harder for them to process the
              content.

              At the outset of the project, our team convened for a group

              <span class="bold">Double-Diamond</span> design process model.
              This model served as a means to discover various approaches to
              design the website layout and define the most effective ideas to

              Before we began our prototype work, we crafted a comprehensive
              design system in Figma that incorporated various elements such as
              <span class="bold"
                >typeface, color scheme, icons, and buttons</span
              >. To ensure consistency throughout the design and to to make the
              website more effortless to construct for a developer, we employed
              <span class="bold">Bootstrap's</span> icons, buttons, and
              components.

            </h2>
            <p class="p-smatrollen">
              Then it was time to create the prototype for their new mobile
              website, the prototype was created in
              <span class="bold">Figma</span> and we used
              <span class="bold">Bootstrap's 12 column grid</span> in order to
              get a responsive and flexible layout. By utilizing heuristic
              evaluation and our design system, we successfully developed a
              prototype that meets the client's requirements and prioritizes the
              user-experience.
            </p>

            <h4 class="h4-prototype">Color</h4>
            <p class="p-smatrollen">
              To achieve a simplistic and minimalistic look, the new website
              design utilized only
              <span class="bold">three colors in varying shades</span>, with
              correct contrast ratios. The background color is off- white and
              the text is in a dark gray shade, providing a warmer feeling than
              a white background with black text. We couldn't incorporate the
              client's preferred color scheme due to poor contrast, but we did
              include a darker shade of green, which was also present in the
              original color scheme, to enhance contrast. The primary colors
              used were off-white and green, as they are associated with nature,
              harmony, and balance.
            </p>

            <h4 class="h4-prototype">Text & logo</h4>
            <p class="p-smatrollen">
              The website's <span class="bold">text is left-aligned</span> for
              optimal readability, and the font style used is
              <span class="bold">Sans Serif</span>, which is commonly used for
              websites due to its suitability. To improve readability, we have
              condensed the content, rephrased the text, and implemented bullet
              points. <span class="bold">Symbolic images</span> were added to
              the headings to bring a playful element to the website's
              appearance and create a welcoming atmosphere for both parents and
              children.  In terms of the logo, we made a few adjustments to
              enhance its readability. We switched to a bolder font since the
              previous one was too thin, and changed the color from light green
              to a darker shade for better contrast with the offwhite
              background.
            </p>

            <h4 class="h4-prototype">Menu & footer</h4>
            <p class="p-smatrollen">
              The placement of the menu icon on the right side of the website
              <span class="bold">follows the standard</span> on other websites,
              where users expect to find this button. To make it clear and
              visible for users where they can find the essential "Contact"
              page, we created a separate button for it. Given that many users
              are new, it was important to ensure high visibility for this
              function, as it is likely the information they need most.
              Additionally, the client with families. A
              <span class="bold">Call-to-Action button</span> is always
              available in the footer of each page to guide users on what to do
              next and to prevent them from missing this important function.
              Clicking on this button takes users to the "Contact" page where
              they can register their interest in enrolling their child at the
              preschool.

              The moment of truth arrived as we presented our two-week project,
              during which we pitched our idea to the client. During the
              presentation, we
              <span class="bold">exhibited the prototype</span> we had designed
              and explained how all our ideas and implementations were founded
              on <span class="bold">research</span> and
              <span class="bold">studies</span> within UX-design. At the outset
              of the presentation, we displayed a
              <span class="bold">QR code</span> that led to the prototype view
              in Figma, allowing the clients to preview the website and gauge
              its feel before we delved into the details.
            </p>

            <p class="p-smatrollen">
              As <span class="bold">one of nine groups</span> that had tackled
              the same project with diverse outcomes for the website, our main
              objective <span class="bold">was to convey</span> why our version
              was the most suitable for the client.

              The stress of completing the project in two weeks became evident
              and
              <span class="bold">affected</span> our
              <span class="bold">work process</span> in various ways. However,
              this stress also had a positive impact on the group as it forced
              us to
              <span class="bold">improve our decision-making skills</span> and
              be satisfied with our accomplishments. We learned to finish work
              segments without striving for perfection.
            </p>

            <p class="p-smatrollen">
              In hindsight, we realized that as a group, we should have created
              an
              <span class="bold">overall schedule</span> at the beginning of the
              project, with <span class="bold">set deadlines</span> for each
              segment, creating a <span class="bold">timeline to follow</span>.
              This would have further challenged us to finish each segment and
              move on to the next.
            </p>

            <p class="p-smatrollen">
              Additionally, I learned the
              <span class="bold">importance of usability testing</span>, which
              we didn't prioritize in this project due to time constraints.
              Allocating time for this would have given us
              <span class="bold">valuable insights</span> into how the website
              <span class="bold">functioned in practice</span> and provided us
              with <span class="bold">external perspectives</span>.
