            <p class="p-smatrollen">
              In the autumn of 2023, I embarked on an enriching 8-week
              internship journey at Lynk & Co Design in Gothenburg. Within this
              period, I chose to be a part of the Digi-Physical team,
              responsible for optimizing the user-friendliness of the physical
              components of the vehicles. This experience not only exposed me to
              the world of physical UX design but also offered a chance to
              contribute to UI design, with a special focus on a mobile
              application.

            <p class="p-internship">
              During my internship, my primary assignment revolved around the
              design of an interactive courtesy light for an upcoming car model.
              The project commenced with getting presenting the initial concept
              for the light, and I was subsequently given a high degree of
              creative autonomy to expand upon it.

            <h4 class="h4-internship">User Research</h4>
            <p class="p-internship">
              I initiated user research for Lynk & Co's vehicle users, with a
              focus on their unique market presence. Lynk & Co designs their
              cars in Gothenburg, Sweden, but primarily targets production and
              sales in China. To gain valuable insights, I delved into the
              research resources available from their research center in China.
              This wealth of information laid a solid foundation for designing
              the courtesy light, allowing me to develop a deep understanding of
              the user base and their preferences.

            <h4 class="h4-internship">User Flow</h4>
            <p class="p-internship">
              Creating a User Flow was a critical step in my project. It helped
              visualize user journeys, guiding my design work in Figma. This
              approach ensured a user-centric focus, aligning the design with
              the company's concept and user experience priorities.

            <h4 class="h4-internship">Prototypes</h4>
            <p class="p-internship">
              I started designing a prototype of what the light would look like
              and function, in Figma. Firstly I created a more concrete design
              with icons to guide the user through the interactions of the
              light, as the company had such a strong emphasis on innovation and
              a playful approach, I wanted to create another version that was
              more abstract to be aligned wih the companys approach. This
              resulted in two distinct design versions of the courtesy light,
              one with a concrete design and one with an abstract design.
            </p>

            <p class="p-internship">
              The concrete version of the light has a power on/off touch button
              to the left, a touch brightness bar on its right, complemented by
              associated icons. Elements were positioned to ensure user comfort
              and provide clear visual cues for the functionalities they
              represent. To enhance the user experience, the idea was for the
              button and the brightness bar and the icons to have a tactile
              depth to them.
            </p>

            <p class="p-internship">
              The abstract version of the light was designed with a pattern as a
              visual guide for users to navigate its functions. On the left side
              of this pattern, a more condensed area indicating both the lowest
              brightness level and the specific touchpoint to turn the light
              on/off. The right side of the pattern has a larger, less condensed
              area, signifying the highest brightness setting. A series of arrow
              pathways within this pattern functions as a brightness bar,
              directing users to swipe their fingers across it for brightness
              adjustment. To enhance the user eexperience, the idea was for the
              pattern to have a tactile depth to it as well, with more depth in
              the left side of the pattern and less depth to the right side of
              the pattern. To further guide the user through the functions.
            </p>

            <p class="p-internship">
              To ascertain user preferences between the two designs, I needed to
              conduct usability tests. Therefore I crafted physical prototypes
              of the lights for test participants to interact with, leveraging
              guidance from my mentor. I utilized a UV printer to apply patterns
              to materials and a laser machine to provide depth to the material.
              My mentor also aided in the implementation of touch interaction.

            <p class="p-internship">
              For the Usability Tests, I developed a comprehensive template
              encompassing questions and scenarios and scheduled test
              participants. With the goal of assessing user perceptions and
              interactions with the two versions of the courtesy light compared
              to a standard one, and to compare the two versions.
            </p>

            <p class="p-internship">
              Several Usability Tests were conducted with participants seated in
              the backseat of a rig that resembled the interor of the car,
              equipped with a physical courtesy light. The participants were of
              different ages with different genders and various job positions in
              order to have a variation in the users. Participants were
              presented with different scenarios. The objective was for users to
              attempt to turn the light on/off and adjust the brightness. They
              got to engage with both versions of the light, with identical
              scenarios and questions. Participants were asked to rate the ease
              of performing the tasks and were asked questions throughout the
              tests. I sat alongside observing their actions.
            </p>

            <p class="p-internship">
              After the Usability Tests, I gathered the data and then analyzed
              the results and categorized the data through thematic analysis in
              order to finns themes and patterns. This revealed a longer list of
              findings in both user behaviour, wishes as well as both positive
              and negative feedback from the participants.

              And the last thing on my internhip was for me to write a report
              and to perform a presentation of all my work with the courtesy
              light to all the department leads, to show a summary of what I
              have done and also what I recommend doing moving forward in this

              During my internship, I got to work on another project as well
              focusing on enhancing a mobile app tailored for an upcoming car
              model. The project empowered me to steer the course of my
              contributions, allowing me to reshape the app's layout for a more
              conventional yet premium appearance. Additionally, I delved into
              creating wireframes for a new function in the app and implementing
              thoughtful UI design and strategic spacing between elements.

            <h4 class="h4-internship">Benchmarking</h4>
            <p class="p-internship">
              Prior to diving into the further development of the app, I
              conducted benchmarking on mobile apps from leading car brands such
              as Hyundai, BMW, and Volvo. This exploration aimed to grasp
              industry standards and anticipate user expectations for our mobile
              app.

            <h4 class="h4-internship">User Research</h4>
            <p class="p-internship">
              My quest for relevant user research led me to a User Clinic, where
              a abundance of user feedback proved invaluable for this project.
              This feedback not only inspired new features for the app but also
              informed strategic changes to the existing UI design.
            </p>

            <h4 class="h4-internship">Prototypes</h4>
            <p class="p-internship">
              Equipped with insights from benchmarking and user research, I
              ventured into the design phase using Figma. Starting with
              Low-Fidelity wireframes, to quickly map out the structure and
              layout of the app, I translated these concepts into High-Fidelity
              Wireframes, bringing the envisioned changes to life.

              providing a visual narrative of the implemented changes and newly
              added features to the app. This presentation connected these
              enhancements to the invaluable insights derived from the User
              Clinic, offering a holistic overview of the project's evolution.

            <p class="p-internship">
              Throughout this internship, I gained valuable insights into the
              realm of Physical UX and its distinctions from the more
              conventional digital UX design. I discovered the synergy between
              my digital UX knowledge and its applicability in the domain of
              physical UX. Additionally, I expanded my understanding of the
              physical aspects of user experiences.
            </p>

            <p class="p-internship">
              My experience in the automotive industry exposed me to the
              intricate world of UX design within this sector. It underscored
              the importance of careful considerations when designing
              interfaces, especially within the context of in-car screens, where
              safety and the primary task of driving are of utmost importance.
            </p>

            <p class="p-internship">
              The importance of a holistic design approach became evident as I
              navigated through projects involving both physical and digital
              interfaces. Integrating physical components like the interactive
              courtesy light with digital experiences in the mobile app
              highlighted the need to consider the user journey as a seamless
              continuum.
